Think about your own PhD project and add keywords to the stations of the research data lifecycle that describe what steps and procedures at each station are relevant to your research data.

Find a workspace at the [Miro-Board](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVPvwAFbI=/?moveToWidget=3458764570165589491&cot=14)

-> Does this research data lifecycle fit to your research project?

## FAIR Data Principles

{{0-1}}
****************

<div style="width:50%;">
  <img src="images/fair2.jpg" alt="targets">
  <sub><span style="text-align: right;">Illustration: Patrick Hochstenbach in Engelhardt, Claudia et. al. (2021)</span></sub>
</div>

****************

{{1-2}}
> An important goal of research data management is to keep data 
>
>🔍 **F**indable,
>
>🔐 **A**ccessible,
>
>🔗 **I**nteroperable and
>
>♻️ **R**eusable
>
>in the ~~long term~~ and ~~independent of individuals~~.


<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

{{2}}
>**F**indable

{{3-4}}
****************
The first step in (re)using data is to find them. Metadata and data should be easy to find for both humans and computers. Machine-readable metadata are essential for automatic discovery of datasets and services, so this is an essential component of the FAIRification process.

F1. (Meta)data are assigned a globally unique and persistent identifier

F2. Data are described with rich metadata (defined by R1 below)

F3. Metadata clearly and explicitly include the identifier of the data they describe

F4. (Meta)data are registered or indexed in a searchable resource

***************

{{2}}
>**A**ccessible

{{4-5}}
***********************
Once the user finds the required data, the user needs to know how data can be accessed, including authentication and authorisation.

A1. (Meta)data are retrievable by their identifier using a standardised communications protocol

A1.1 The protocol is open, free, and universally implementable

A1.2 The protocol allows for an authentication and authorisation procedure, where necessary

A2. Metadata are accessible, even when the data are no longer available

******************

{{2}}
>**I**nteroperable

{{5-6}}
**********************
The data usually needs to be integrated with other data. In addition, the data needs to interoperate with applications or workflows for analysis, storage, and processing.

I1. (Meta)data use a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language for knowledge representation.

I2. (Meta)data use vocabularies that follow FAIR principles

I3. (Meta)data include qualified references to other (meta)data

**********************

{{2}}
>**R**eusable

{{6-7}}
***************
The ultimate goal of FAIR is to optimise the reuse of data. To achieve this, metadata and data should be well-described so that they can be understood, replicated and/or combined in different settings.

R1. Meta(data) are richly described with a plurality of accurate and relevant attributes

R1.1. (Meta)data are released with a clear and accessible data usage license

R1.2. (Meta)data are associated with detailed provenance

R1.3. (Meta)data meet domain-relevant community standards

### General notes

{{0-3}}
*****************

- **Never touch raw data! Always keep your raw data unchanged in a separate folder**.

********************************************************************************

{{1-3}}
********************************************************************************

- Try to find ‘speaking’ names for folders and files ➞ no ‘fantasy names’ 🦄, no random character strings

- Develop a standardised scheme and a logical structure

  - for both folder and file names.

  - Folders in hierarchical order with the most important first.

  - Limit yourself to a maximum of three folder levels, ensure a maximum path length of 256 characters.

  - Keep your personal preferences in mind during development, e.g. for ___sorting!___

********************************************************************************

{{2-3}}
********************************************************************************
- Follow [***ISO 8601***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) for dates and times

  - Date and time, e.g. YYYY-MM-DD-hh-mm-ss or YYYYMMDDhhmmss

********************************************************************************

{{3-4}}
********************************************************************************

- Always avoid spaces and all special characters (including special letters, such as german umlauts).

  - The following characters in particular should **NOT** be used in folder or file names:

    - less than: <

    - greater than: >

    - colon: :
    
    - double quotation mark: “
    
    - slash: /
    
    - backslash: \
    
    - vertical bar or pipe: |
    
    - question mark: ?
    
    - asterisk: \*

  - The only unproblematic special characters in folder or file names are underscore (_) and hyphen/minus (-)

********************************************************************************

{{4-7}}
********************************************************************************

- Prefix consecutive numbers with a sufficient number of zeros (e.g. 001 for numbering from 1 to 100)

********************************************************************************

{{5-7}}
********************************************************************************

- Use only one dot per file name -> between the file name and format suffix (e.g. filename.txt)

********************************************************************************

{{6-7}}
********************************************************************************

- Upper and lower case is considered different by some file systems, but not by others.  

********************************************************************************

{{7}}
********************************************************************************

- ***Document*** your folder structures as well as the naming conventions and abbreviations used!

  - Readme.md

### Back up vs. long-term storage

| Back up                                                                          | Long-term storage             |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Automatic backup of all data   | Storage of only selected data |
| All versions                                                                     | Final version only            |
|   to prevent data loss <br>(technical, e.g. defective, <br>or human, e.g. accidentally deleted) | Integrity backup <br> (e. g. regular check for modified or damaged data, <br>file system consitency)      |
|                                                                                  | Long-term storage             |
|                                                                                  | Searchability                 |

### Open Access

>"Open access is the term given to access granted to research publications and other materials online free of charge. A research document published under open access conditions may be read, downloaded, saved, linked to, printed and used by anybody at no cost."
>
>Source: [DFG](https://www.dfg.de/en/research_funding/programmes/infrastructure/lis/open_access/what_is_open_access/index.html)

<div style="float:left; width:80%;">
**Open access** contributions are often represented with the help of an open lock.

- Distribution of research output online, __freely available__ for everyone

  - __no restrictions__ for use und republication

  - In practice: __attribution__ to the original author or creator

- Formerly only open publication of journal articles, papers, etc.

### Open Data

>"Open data are data that have been made available for free use, re-use and dissemination. They can comprise any kind of data from learning materials to geographical data, statistics, traffic data, academic publications, medical data, radio and tv broadcasts.
>
>In oder to mark data as "open", different choices of license are available. Data with restrictive licences, which limit use by prohibiting derivatives or commercial use, do not strictly count as "open data" even though they can certainly improve the academic exchange of ideas." (https://forschungsdaten.info/praxis-kompakt/english-pages/open-data-open-access-and-re-using-data/)

- Open Data

  - Publication of data without legal or technical restrictions
  - for use, re-use and dissemination
  - __Indispensable__ for data science
  - Generic __non-proprietary__ formats
  - different types of data as well as __Metadata__

## Take-Away Messages

> Practical Take-Away Messages

1. <p style="color:#9a047f">**Document your data**</p>

{{1-2}}
************
>- Use documented naming and versioning conventions
>
>- document changes
>
>- think about metadata necessary to understand your data

*************

2. <p style="color:#9a047f">**Formats**</p>

{{2-3}}
************
>  - __Generic and open standard file formats__ last longer than proprietary file formats
>
>    - Open Document Format (ODF)
>
>    - Comma separated values (CSV)
>
>    - Raw text files (TXT, MD)
>
>  - __Data container formats__ for __exchange, archival and publication__, e.g., [BagIt](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8493), [Frictionless Data](https://frictionlessdata.io/)

*************

3. <p style="color:#9a047f">**Storage**</p>

{{3-4}}
**********
>  - __Central infrastructure with backup__ for storage
>
>  - Desktop and laptop for work on current research data only
>
>  - Systematic file and folder naming and hierarchy
>
>  - Provide _Readme_ files
>
>  - Data Management Middleware for handling data and metadata, e.g., [iRODS](https://irods.org/)
>
>  - DFG [Guidelines for Safeguarding Good Research Practice](https://www.dfg.de/en/research_funding/principles_dfg_funding/good_scientific_practice/index.html)  require 10 years of preservation at least!
